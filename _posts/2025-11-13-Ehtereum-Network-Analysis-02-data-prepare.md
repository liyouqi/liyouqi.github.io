## Data Source Selection
There are many ways to explore Ethereum data on internet, genereally through blockchain explorers or public datasets. Kaggle is a good choice for datasets which is prepared and cleaned, but I can not find the newest Ethereum data there. What's more, I need different data such as token transfers, contracts, blocks, etc and all of these data should be filtered by specific time period and value threshold, so I decide to use some retrieval tools to get consistent data by myself. After searching and asking ChatGPT, I find Google BigQuery eventually meets my needs.

# Data Source: 
Google BigQuery Public Datasets - [Crypto Ethereum](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/crypto_ethereum)


# Data selection criteria:
if I have a high-performance computer with enough storage space, I can esily just Seletct * from the whole dataset. But with a laptop, I need to trade-off in order to get manageable data size. 

That is tough. Even for one week data, the size of raw data is more than 1TB. Capacity is managable, but the processsing phase may take too long time. So I decide to limit the time period to one day, and only select high-value transactions (whale transactions) for analysis. Yes, you know, how huch shitcoins and rubbish tokens are there in Ethereum network. 
To avoid too much noise, I only focus on stablecoins (USDC, USDT) and wrapped ETH (WETH) for token transfers, and ETH value for normal transactions.

#### in brief:
- Time period: 2025-11-11 00:00:00 to 2025-11-12 00:00:00 (24 hours)
- Value threshold: $10,000 USD equivalent   
- Tokens: USDC, USDT, WETH (for stablecoins and wrapped ETH)
- Data tables: token_transfers, transactions, blocks, contracts
- Data cleaning: remove nested/complex fields for easier export
- Export format: CSV (for compatibility with various analysis tools)
- Data storage: Google BigQuery (for large-scale data handling)


##### Some notes on BigQuery:
- Be careful with reserved keywords **hash**, if needed, use backticks
- If the file size is too large e.g. >1GB, you can not download it directly, you need to export it to Google Cloud Storage first, then download from there. Another trick is to open a querry editor in BigQuery console, run a SELECT * query on the table, and then use the "Save Results" option to download a sample of the data directly. Then, you don't have to bother with credit card and billing settings.

I'll share the SQL code bolow and upload the row data files to GitHub repo.
